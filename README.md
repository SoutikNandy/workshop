# Workshop
To all the Space Enthusiasts and novice coders out there, we have brought to you an online module on Python with Space Applications üöÄ

The Training Programme would teach you the intermediate level of Python as well as various problem statements which will be dealt with to get a good grasp of its applications in space sciences. üêç

Weekly classes will be held in this Training Programme, with a set of problem statements based on the same concepts taught. 

These problem statements vary from daily life applications to space applications like making your own Discord Bot, Detecting Hidden Pulsars, Sending mails, Visualising Sunspots, and many more. 

"Per Python Ad Astra," which translates to "To the Stars through Python," is our motto, which is a slightly adapted Latin phrase.

So come along with us on this incredible journey to the stars using Python.
